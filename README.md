## Issues

- When card array is randomised, there is no check that there is a valid move the player can make. This means there is a chance for players to get impossible rounds when they hit a certain score (~25).

  - Easiest quick fix to this would be to instanstly reshuffle the array if it doesn't contain a non selected card, but this is not a particularly good algorithm.

- Card emojis in footer look different in different browsers. Some of the coloured versions are difficult to see against the background colour.

  - Test different browers with slightly different background colour palettes

- Card images are lazy loaded (by default). Since not all cards are shown at once, players (especially on first playthough) will have to wait for images to load.

  - Find a way to eager load images
  - and / or
  - use a loading spinner till all images are loaded
  - and / or
  - Show a default image (ie a card back) until all images are loaded

## Possible Future Features

- Make the gameplay "endless" - after reaching 52(or a multiple of), the selected flag of all cards is reset but the score persists
- Add more visual feedback when a player loses
- Ability to change difficulty of game
- Ability to pick different themes (ie different sets of images)
- Use external apis to fetch images instead of using static images, depending on theme

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
